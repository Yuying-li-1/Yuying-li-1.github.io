Hello, My name is Yuying Li. You can call me Rarity.

My major is mathematics-computer science.

~~This is beacuse I failed to enroll in the CSE majors due to the bad luck.~~

### Program language I have learned before

- C

**Java is the best language!!!**

### My to do list of CSE 110
- [x] enroll in the course
- [ ] take classes carefully
- [ ] finish group projects
- [ ] get an A

### A function help you to success in CSE 110
```
public void cse110(Student S) {
    S.takeClassesCarfully();
    S.doEveryAssignments();
    S.finishProjrcts();
    return;
}
```
